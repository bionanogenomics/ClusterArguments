# ClusterArguments

This clusterArguments.xml is compatible with Bionano Solve 3.1. Running the assembly via command-line on a cluster requires a properly configured clusterArgument.xml file (-C parameter).  Users need to configure the clusterArguments_custom.xml for their own cluster. For more details. please go to "Running Bionano Solve Pipeline on Command Line - 30205" [here](https://bionanogenomics.com/support-page/bionano-solve/).
